Given a DAG, there exists topological orders that cannot result from applying a DFS-based algorithm, no matter in what order the vertices adjacent to each vertex are chosen.

An example is the following:

DAG:
0 -> 1
0 -> 2
2 -> 3

1    2 -> 3
^   ^
 \ /
  0

For this graph, the following topological order cannot result from applying a DFS-based algorithm:
0 - 2 - 1 - 3

DFS will always follow the branches 0 -> 1 and 0 -> 2 -> 3 (depending on the order that the adjacent vertices were chosen), but will never examine vertex 1 after vertex 2 and before vertex 3.
